# OpenCensus Overview
OpenCensus allows you to gain complete visibility and situation-clarity of your distributed services' request lifecycle.

The core functionality of OpenCensus is to collect traces and metrics from your app, display them locally, and send them to any analysis tool. However, OpenCensus provides a lot more than just data insight. This page describes some of that functionality and points you to resources for building it into your app.
