OpenCensus is a vendor-agnostic, single distribution of libraries that provide observability of microservices and monoliths alike. OpenCensus provides distributed tracing and monitoring. It is implemented in a variety of languages like:

* Go
* Java
* Python
* C++
* PHP
* Ruby
* Node.js

OpenCensus is the entirely open sourced rewrite of the observability systems
that have powered Google's planet scale infrastructure for the past 10 years.

OpenCensus allows you to collect metrics and traces singly in your application and then export
them to a plethora of backends like:

* AWS X-Ray
* Stackdriver Tracing and Monitoring
* Zipkin
* Jaeger
* Prometheus
