Congratulations! You are one step away from learning how to gain clarity with your distributed architecture by using OpenCensus.

There are **two** different quickstarts, and each are geared towards solving a different problem.

Do you want to...

Use **Metrics** to gain a big picture understanding of your architecture by recording important information such as service latency, payload size, open file descriptors, and more?

Or do you want to...

Use **Tracing** to see how a request travels throughout your microservices and arm yourself with the tools to perform root cause analysis and latency optimization?

#### Let's Go!

When you are done with the quickstarts, you will know how to install, configure, and export your data to a backend and begin visualizing your information!
